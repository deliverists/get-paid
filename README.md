## pre-reqs:

 * yarn
 * aws account
 * docker client
 * virtualbox
 * expo and genymotion
 * run genymotion and start up an android virtual device (TODO: automate this on the cli using gmtool as part of Genymotion 2.5.0 - paid license)
 * `adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000` to open up the localhost 3000 port to the android emulator
 * for lambda local: python 2.7, pip and: `pip install --user aws-sam-cli`

## running locally:

 * `. script/init` will initialise your terminal for the project
 * `local:start:be` will start up dynamodb (and create tables/data) and graphql server
 * `local:start:site` will start up the react website
 * `local:start:mobile` will start up the android app in the emulator

### interacting with local services:

 * browse to dynamodb shell: `http://localhost:8000/shell/`
 * interact with dynamodb with the awscli: `aws dynamodb <command> --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000`
 * browse to graphql: `http://localhost:3000/graphql`
 * browse to the react website: `http://localhost:3001/`

## todo

 * get react native debugging working
 * expand reusability/templating so all the Invoices specific cf resolver/datasource resources can be autogenerated from the dynamo table config + the rmt vtl templates
 * get mutations / invoice listing, creation editing working - more full graphql schema
 * test it working against appsync online as well as local
 * how does the state get stored into the react-navigation props with react-apollo? how would we do something similar with react-router
 * move the website to metalsmith
 * standardise all node projects to the same setup/lint/pretty etc.
 * where is the appsync error handling - why can't I see connection/auth errors on the appsync client?

 * get some OUTPUTs from the cf template - i.e. appsync app id - then you can chain the command: `aws appsync get-graphql-api --api-id zu62e235bzg45j4iw7bxhvytyq --region us-east-1` to the script to get the graphql endpoint

 * rename read-local-file to some sort of filesystem helper
 * create a shared package for read-local-file so we aren't importing between packages

 * get branch deployment working (canary deployments)
 * are the templates in the cloudformation s3 bucket shared across branches - potential bleed problem?

## client sharing - still testing react-native-web-starter

 * Choose web/native sharing mechanism:

## bugs

 * definitions3location was giving a 403 despite it looking like it was public-read to me shrug
   - probably should just have been a bucket name instead of a url - shouldn't have to make them public-read
   - this is because you have to do a cloudformation package to send the package to s3


 * current state of deploy: got half way through trying to configure a lambda deployment from a sam template/transform in the cloudformation package - probably almost done with it, but now moving away from lambda to ecs and containers because lambda -> rds seems problematic re: connection pooling and vpc set up creating slow cold starts.
