# get-paid

## todo

 * test schema sdl file uploaded to s3 (along with cf template)
 * test graphql api created correctly using the schema
 * add the api key generation and linking
 * add the resolvers
 * test querying our graphql api

 * build expo/react native simple app that uses the graphql api
 * reuse expo work to create a website version (reusing all same code possible?)

 * create a good local development story for the whole piece
 * get branch deployment working (canary deployments)
 * are the templates in the cloudformation s3 bucket shared across branches - potential bleed problem?

## bugs

 * definitions3location was giving a 403 despite it looking like it was public-read to me shrug
