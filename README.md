# get-paid

## pre-reqs:

 * yarn
 * aws account
 * docker client
 * virtualbox
 * expo and genymotion
 * run genymotion and start up an android virtual device (TODO: automate this on the cli using gmtool as part of Genymotion 2.5.0 - paid license)

## running locally:

 * `. script/init` will initialise your terminal for the project
 * `local:start:be` will start up dynamodb (and create tables/data) and graphql server
 * `local:start:site` will start up the react website
 * `local:start:mobile` will start up the android app in the emulator

### interacting with local services:

 * browse to dynamodb shell: `http://localhost:8000/shell/`
 * interact with dynamodb with the awscli: `aws dynamodb <command> --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000`
 * browse to graphql: `http://localhost:3000/graphql`
 * browse to the react website: `http://localhost:3001/`

## todo

 * Choose web/native sharing mechanism:

 * create a shared modules folder for the react-site and the mobile project for components/ appsync connections
 * move the website to metalsmith
 * standardise all node projects to the same setup/lint/pretty etc.
 * choose react-navigation or react-router for the shared routing mechanisms
 * how does the state get stored into the react-navigation props with react-apollo? how would we do something similar with react-router
 * why does the local appsync client work against the local graph api in the react-site but not in the mobile app? - is it because it can't see localhost?
 * where is the appsync error handling - why can't I see connection/auth errors on the appsync client?

 * get some OUTPUTs from the cf template - i.e. appsync app id - then you can chain the command: `aws appsync get-graphql-api --api-id zu62e235bzg45j4iw7bxhvytyq --region us-east-1` to the script to get the graphql endpoint

 * rename read-local-file to some sort of filesystem helper
 * create a shared package for read-local-file so we aren't importing between packages

 * expand reusability/templating so all the Invoices specific cf resolver/datasource resources can be autogenerated from the dynamo table config + the rmt vtl templates

 * build expo/react native simple app that uses the graphql api
 * reuse expo work to create a website version (reusing all same code possible?)

 * create a good local development story for the whole piece
 * get branch deployment working (canary deployments)
 * are the templates in the cloudformation s3 bucket shared across branches - potential bleed problem?

## bugs

 * definitions3location was giving a 403 despite it looking like it was public-read to me shrug
