# Get Paid web, android and ios clients

## Introduction

Built from the [React Native Web Starter](https://github.com/joefazz/react-native-web-starter) by @joefazz (Joe Fazzino)

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you can run `yarn web` to start up the dev web server.

Integrated with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and running `yarn ios` or `yarn android` will start the Expo packager.
